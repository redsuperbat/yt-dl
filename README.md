# Youtube Downloader

Simplest youtube downloader you will find. I made so I did not have to use the 🔥GOD🔥 forsaken websites to download YT videos for watching offline.

## 💿 Installation

```shell
npm i -g yt-dl
```

## ⚡️ Usage

```shell
yt-dl <url> [filepath]
```

If no filepath is supplied it will be saved in the current working directory.

That is all folks!
