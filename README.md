# Youtube Downloader

Simplest Youtube downloader you will find. I made this CLI so I would not have to use the ad-littered, 💀forsaken💀, unwieldy websites to download YT videos for watching offline.

## 💿 Installation

```shell
npm i -g ez-yt-dl
```

## ⚡️ Usage

```shell
ez-yt-dl <url> [filepath]
```

## 😎 Without installation

```shell
npx ez-yt-dl <url> [filepath]
```

If no filepath is supplied it will be saved in the current working directory.

That is all folks!
